# Settlers 4 Hotkey scripts

Hotkey script for the game Settlers 4. These add additional hotkeys to your game. Works through [autohotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/).

## Installation

- Get autohotkey
- Values in this repo are preconfigured for a screen with a 1920 x 1080 resolution. If you use a different resolution, adjust the coordinates values under `PIXEL SETTINGS` in the .ahk script. You can get these values either with the `getCoordsAndColorWithZ.exe` by pressing "z" on your keyboard on the desired location or by the use of autohotkeys provided software `Window Spy`, which is included in the autohotkey installation
- (optional) If you want, adjust the hotkeys to your needs, otherwise you can use the defaults
- Compile the .ahk script with autohotkey version 1
- Run the compiled .exe script (with admin rights)

## More info
